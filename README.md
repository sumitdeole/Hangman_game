# Hangman game

Here, I will attempt to code the hangman game that allows the following tricks:
1. A comprehensive English words dataset from NLTK
2. Only alphabet characters as user input are possible. No repetitions!
3. A simplistic graphical display of the hanging (dark!)
4. A total of 6 mistakes are allowed --> can be made flexible upon following the steps described in the comment.
5. After the game is completed, you will be asked whether you want to replay!
